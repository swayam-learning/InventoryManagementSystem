🛒 Inventory Management System
Welcome to the Inventory Management System! This project is one of my first ventures into file handling and manipulation in Python. It has been an exciting learning experience, and I'm thrilled to share it with you.

📜 Project Description
The Inventory Management System handles various functionalities such as buying items in specific quantities, generating bills, updating the list of items available in the inventory, and tracking sales. This project leverages CSV file handling in Python to achieve these tasks.

Key Features:
🛍️ Buying Items: Purchase items in desired quantities.
🧾 Generating Bills: Create bills for the purchased items.
📦 Inventory Update: Automatically updates the inventory list.
📈 Sales Tracking: Logs sales details in a file named KitnaSamaanBecha (which translates to "how much product was sold" in English).
📁 Files in this Project
Inventory.txt: Contains the current list of items in the inventory.
SalesDone.csv: A CSV file that logs all sales transactions.
KitnaSamaanBecha.txt: Tracks the sales details in a human-readable format.
🚀 How It Works
User Input: The user inputs their name, email, phone number, product ID, and quantity.
Product Lookup: The system checks the inventory for the product.
Purchase Validation: Verifies if the desired quantity is available.
Billing: Generates a bill and displays the details.
Inventory Update: Updates the inventory file with the new quantities.
Sales Logging: Logs the sales transaction in the SalesDone.csv and KitnaSamaanBecha.txt files.
